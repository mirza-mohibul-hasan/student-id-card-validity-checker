Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

The dataset includes 275 images.
Name are annotated in YOLOv8 Oriented Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit (white edges))

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Randomly crop between 0 and 15 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -10째 to +10째 horizontally and -10째 to +10째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.1 percent of pixels
